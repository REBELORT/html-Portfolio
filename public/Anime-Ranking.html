<h1>The Best Anime According to Rohit</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Anime of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Naruto</h3>

<p>This anime has total 700 episodes but it's worth wathing. 
    I like it's story ,character details, aimation and all of it most of all the MC's resolve to Never Give Up.</p>

    <h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3>

    <p>Dragon ball one of my most favourate Anime. This Anime is connected to my Heart because I am watching This anime since my childhood. The main charater Goku was a child back then I was a child to I grow watching him as he grows.</p>

    <h3>Black Clover</h3>

    <p>When I started watching Black clover then it takes only 3 episodes to win over my heart beacuse of the story it's story is very Unique full of magic and fantacy but the main character was not born with magic he was an outcast of the world of magic where every one has magic but he has not even 1 Drop of magic. It truly tuched my heart because I know how it feels like to be an outcast. It has 170 episodes but it is worth watching.</p>
